
The resource compiler in this archive can be used to produce
help files for e.g. OPL applications. For further information
on using Help files from OPL refer to the archive Helpkit1.zip
in psion\files on CIX.

To try out the example, type:

    rcomp example.rss

- and view the resulting example.rsc file with your normal help viewer
(such as Helpshow.opl in Helpkit1.zip)

Performing the above operation will also generate a header (example.rsg)
which contains the resource numbers of the various help pages. 

If you are using a PC based development environment such
as ODE, then you can #include this header directly. 

The information in the generated header file will
allow your application to display context sensitive help. 

For further information on the use of resource files, please refer
to the documentation in the Four Volume Psion SDK.
