A spoof voice-call app for the Psion Series 3a

Originally written in 1996 in Psion OPL.

At the time I was using a Psion Series 3a along with the Vodafone "Telenote" app to send/recevie SMS messages from the Psion via an attached Nokia GSM/PCN phone. I created this app as a prank to fool my colleagues at the time that I could also make/receive voice calls via the Psion/Nokia combo.

The app prestends to connect to the attached movbile network, allows the  user to enter a nunber a plays dial/MF/rinign tones. The app then plays a HELLO.WVE file that sounds like someone has picked up/answered the call. This file can be customised so you can have whoever.whatever you liek answering your fake call :-D

NOTE: This is just a copy of the complete PHONEY folder I found on a floppy (yes, an actual floppy disk!) for archival purposes so it also contains a lot of the tools used to create this on a PC: S3ATRAN.EXE translator, WSPCE.EXE Psion PIC bitmap combiner, AKA.EXE code obfuscator and Jezar's help compiler for OPL.
